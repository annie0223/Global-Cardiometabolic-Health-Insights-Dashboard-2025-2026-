### Project Overview
In the modern healthcare landscape, Cardiometabolic Syndrome—a cluster of conditions including hypertension, elevated blood sugar, and abnormal cholesterol—remains a leading driver of global mortality.
This project involved the development of an end-to-end analytical solution to monitor and visualize global cardiometabolic trends. Using a dataset of 130+ regional health insights, I engineered a Power BI dashboard that transforms complex biomarker data into a strategic tool for identifying high-risk populations, understanding demographic triggers, and evaluating user engagement with preventative health plans.

### Clinical Objectives
As the lead analyst, I focused the project on three core pillars:
1.	Risk Stratification: Identifying geographical "hotspots" where cardiovascular and metabolic risks converge.
2.	Early Intervention Mapping: Pinpointing the exact age-demographic "tipping points" where metabolic health begins to decline.
3.	Actionable Health Outcomes: Measuring the "Insight-to-Action" funnel—how likely high-risk users are to adopt personalized nutrition and supplement interventions.

### The Technical Stack 
A hiring manager looks for end-to-end capability. Here is how I applied my toolkit:
-	Data Orchestration (Excel/SQL): Performed initial data profiling and integrity checks to ensure consistency across 49 columns of regional health metrics.
-	ETL & Data Engineering (Power Query):  Handled complex time-series data (period, month, year).
	   - Normalized demographic percentages to ensure accurate cross-regional comparisons.
-	Advanced Analytics (DAX): Created custom measures to calculate:
     - Aggregate Cardiometabolic Risk: A weighted composite of CV risk and Metabolic scores.
     - Rolling Abnormal Rates: To identify if health trends were improving or deteriorating over the 24-month period.
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): (Optional mention) Used for correlation matrices to validate the link between inflammation (CRP) and metabolic syndrome.
-	Visualization (Power BI): Designed a high-density, interactive dashboard using Bubble Charts, Heatmaps, and Tornado Charts for gender-risk comparisons.
### Key Insights Delivered
-	The Age 45 Tipping Point: Analysis revealed that metabolic risk scores spike by 12% once the population demographic shifts toward the 45-59 age bracket, suggesting a window for intensive preventative screening.
-	Biomarker Drivers: Identified that LDL Cholesterol and HbA1c (Blood Sugar) are the primary abnormal biomarkers driving "Critical Risk" status globally.
-	Geography vs. Risk: Western Europe and North America showed distinct "Risk-profiles," with one leading in cardiovascular indicators and the other in nutritional deficiencies (Vitamin D/B12).
-	Conversion Success: Regions with higher "Report Detail" (avg_report_pages) saw a 18% higher uptake in nutrition plan requests, proving that data transparency drives user health-ownership.
